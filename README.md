Chat Bubbles
============

A simple Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.19.2 to display chat bubbles above players' heads when they chat in-game. Intended to work with Vanilla chat, and Hypixel server chat.

Once again, this was created to fulfill a specific purpose - if you actually use this and find a bug / improvement, open an issue and I'll see what I can do!
